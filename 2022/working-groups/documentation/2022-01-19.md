### Last week's action items


### Agenda
- Automated link-checker
    - Draga will take a look at this in the next week or two and see if we can get it working as intended.
- Missing public API docs
    - some parts of the public API are not documented because API docs are manually "whitelisted" for inclusion
    - we need a full review of the API so that we can start making some of the things we *don't* want public, private
    - this is kind of a huge effort, but it's not going to get any smaller
- Multi-repo website
    - numpy uses 3 repos for its documentation, separating project site, documentation and tutorials
    - thoughts?
        - Juan prefers keeping things together because it's tricky otherwise to remember what documentation goes where
        - Draga/Nick argue that there is a semantic difference between project website "stuff" and documentation e.g. newsfeeds, survey ctas, etc.
        - Talley thinks this separation could all be achieved via a custom theme that can be installed and provides custom directives
- pip installable theme?
    - this is totally possible and it can be specified as a sphinx theme, but behind the scenes it needs to download node and other build tools
    - can a distribution be made that includes everything?
        - yes but it's probably going to be a larger lift
        - however, bringing the entire node environment to the user for local builds is not desirable
            - local preview shouldn't require it
    - Jeremy suggests that there should be a way to maintain separation of concerns but still keep interactivity through bringing in react components "on demand"
        - but again, it's a large lift (at a very broad, shot in the dark estimate, 4-6 weeks)
- theme design
    - in regards to the API reference, it may be easier to match the look and feel we want by expanding on or overwriting elements of an existing theme like furo or sphinx-pydata
- See [this comment](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3930#issuecomment-1016986385) for a summary of the discussion.
